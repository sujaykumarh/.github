## Getting started

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

<br>

### 🐞 Issues

**Create a new issue** 

before you create a new issue, [search if issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

**Solve an issue**

Scan through our **existing issues** to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See **Labels** for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### 🛠️ Make Changes

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR. Before you contribute by **PR** please make sure


* Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

* Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.

* As you update your PR and apply changes, [mark each conversation as resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations). This will help us to understand how your PR is progressing.

* We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

* If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
* check for typos or spelling mistakes in the changes before you commit

* format document before submission to ensure it is readable and easy to review
