# Sponsors

Thank you for your sponsorship. I'm grateful for your support.

Here are the things that I want to make sure you get:

* Your name or logo that you provided will be displayed as long as you are a sponsor. Once you are no longer a sponsor, your name or logo will be removed from the original display location, and moved to **previous sponsors** section on my website or the project website.
  
* If you are a premium sponser i.e, `$1000+` your logo or banner will be displayed as long as you are a sponsor. Once you are no longer a sponsor it'll be visible for `1 year` on the original display location, and moved to **previous sponsors** section on my website or the project website.

* If you are a premium sponsor, you will be able to see the sponsor's logo or banner on the project website.
